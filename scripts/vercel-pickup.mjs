/**
 * The rules `check-vercel-pickup.mjs` uses to decide whether Vercel picked up
 * a push, kept apart from the network calls so they can be tested without
 * GitHub or Vercel (src/app/vercel-pickup.test.ts).
 *
 * Why it exists: on 10 Oct 2026 yuvoy-app's release #174 merged to `main` and
 * Vercel's Git integration never saw the push. No commit status, no
 * deployment, no retry, both status pages green, and app.yuvoy.in kept
 * serving the previous release for hours. operators.yuvoy.in deploys the
 * same way. GitHub hands pushes to Vercel only through the Vercel GitHub App,
 * whose delivery log only Vercel can read, and a lost delivery is never
 * retried. The loss cannot be prevented from this side; deploy-watchdog.yml
 * notices it and deploys from Actions instead. Ported from yuvoy-app
 * (11 Oct 2026).
 *
 * The signal is Vercel's commit status: context `Vercel`, creator
 * `vercel[bot]`, posted within seconds of every push Vercel receives, while
 * the build is still queued. Any state counts, failure included, and so does
 * a production deployment of the commit in any state. Either means Vercel SAW
 * the push, and a build Vercel ran and failed, or that somebody cancelled, is
 * a decision to look at, not a lost push to paper over with a second build.
 * A status older than the push does not count: the same commit pushed to
 * `dev` first carries a preview's status, which says nothing about `main`.
 *
 * Deploying an OLDER commit over a newer one is the mistake that matters most,
 * so nothing here answers `missing` unless the branch is known to still point
 * at the commit. A push of several commits is watched for its head only,
 * which is also the only one Vercel deploys.
