/**
 * A fetch that gives up on a connection that has gone quiet (production
 * readiness, 6 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Nothing that called the API had a deadline. A server render that asked a
 * stalled API held the screen until the platform's own limit, five minutes,
 * with an operator on a dock watching a page that never came; a Server
 * Action did the same to a button. Ported from yuvoy-app, where the same gap
 * was found the same day.
 *
 * ## Silence is timed, not the whole transfer
 *
 * The deadline fires when no answer has begun, or no more of one has arrived,
 * for `stallMs`. A slow link that is still delivering is never cut off, and a
 * dead one is given up on in seconds. A deadline on the whole transfer would
 * have to choose between those two, and on a dock's signal either choice is
 * wrong for somebody.
 *
 * ## The answer comes back already read
 *
 * The body is read inside the deadline. A connection that drops halfway
 * through an answer is then the same fault as one that never answered, and a
 * read is retried as one, instead of the failure surfacing later as a JSON
 * parse error that nothing retries. Every answer this is used for is a few
 * kilobytes, a statement's CSV included, so holding it whole costs nothing.
 * Never use it for an upload: an upload is silent while it sends.
 *
 * ## `fetch` is never handed a `Request` together with a signal
 *
 * On the server that pairing loses the abort. Next 16.3's patched `fetch`
 * folds the init into a new `Request` and then copies THAT into a second one,
 * keeping only the second (`next/dist/server/lib/patch-fetch.js`). The first,
 * and the controller the signal is relayed through, can be garbage-collected
 * mid-request, and after a collection the abort never reaches the socket. In
 * a plain Node experiment a fetch aborted at one second ran its full four,
 * and in yuvoy-app's suite a 3s budget let a render wait 4.5s for an answer
 * (production readiness, 6 Oct 2026). A URL with its init keeps the signal in
 * the init, which `fetch` follows directly, so that is all this ever passes.
 * A side effect: Next does not memoise a read that carries a signal, so a
 * read two parts of a render share is shared with React's `cache`.
