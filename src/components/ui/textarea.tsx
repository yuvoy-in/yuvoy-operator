/**
 * Every textarea in the portal: a `<textarea>` that keeps what was typed into
 * it before the page hydrated.
 *
 * React keeps an input's value as it hydrates, with the server's default
 * beside it, so a change made before the script arrived can be found and
 * taken (`useChangedBeforeHydration`). A textarea's it throws away. Stable
 * React writes the server's text back over whatever the field holds as it
 * hydrates (`initTextarea`; only the experimental channel's `hydrateTextarea`
 * keeps it), and does it before any effect could read the field. So About,
 * rewritten on a slow link while the script was on its way, went back to the
 * old words the moment the script arrived, and a listing's description saved
 * the old one (the stability pass's stress run, 6 Oct 2026). A textarea drawn
 * empty is spared: React only writes back text that is there.
 *
 * So this reads the field in the render that hydrates it, the last moment it
 * holds what was typed, and draws that; then puts the server's text back as
 * its default, where React leaves an input's, for whoever owns the text to
 * take the change. It finds the field by its id (its own, given none): that
 * render comes before any ref.
