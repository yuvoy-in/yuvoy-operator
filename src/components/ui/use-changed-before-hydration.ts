/**
 * Hands a component the fields somebody changed before the page hydrated.
 *
 * The server draws a form, and on a slow link it is there for seconds before
 * the script that owns it: long enough to type a number, tick a box or pick
 * an option, and for the browser to autofill. React keeps all of that on
 * screen as it hydrates, but it replays no change for it (its own fix,
 * `enableHydrationChangeEvent`, is on only in React's experimental channel,
 * and Next ships the stable one). So the state the component keeps still
 * holds what the server drew, and the screen and the state disagree: ten
 * digits over a disabled "Send me a code", a search that searched nothing, a
 * switch that shows on and was never saved. The field's next render then
 * writes the state back over what was typed, and it is gone. The stability
 * pass's stress run caught it on sign-in (6 Oct 2026).
 *
 * Hydration leaves every field as it found it and its default where the
 * server drew it (`defaultValue`, `defaultChecked`, the option marked
 * `selected`), so a field whose two differ was changed by hand. Those go to
 * `onChanged` together, once, so a component can take several changes in one
 * update: the same state its own `onChange` sets. A radio counts only once
 * chosen, as a change event would. A field the browser drew holds its
 * default as it mounts, so it never reads as changed, and asking causes no
 * render: nothing happens unless somebody got there first.
 *
 * A textarea drawn with text never gets here on its own: React writes that
 * text back over what was typed as it hydrates. `Textarea` keeps it, and
 * leaves it to be found like an input's.
 *
 * `ref` is a field, or anything holding several (a list of rows, a group of
 * radios).
