/**
 * The rules deploy-watchdog.yml deploys production by, tested without GitHub
 * or Vercel.
 *
 * On 10 Oct 2026 yuvoy-app's release #174 merged to `main` and Vercel's Git
 * integration never saw the push: no status, no deployment, and app.yuvoy.in
 * served the release before it for hours. operators.yuvoy.in deploys the
 * same way, and the watchdog deploys such a push from Actions.
 * Two mistakes would cost more than the outage it exists for, and these pin
 * both shut: deploying a push Vercel DID pick up, which races Vercel's own
 * build for the domain, and deploying a commit `main` has moved past, which
 * rolls production back. The second is checked over every combination of
 * answers at the end.
