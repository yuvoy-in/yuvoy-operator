      This is not tidiness. Playwright only copies its trace-viewer bundle
      into playwright-report/ when a test FAILS, so the first failing e2e run
      dropped ~500 KB of minified vendor JS into the lint path and `pnpm lint`
      then failed with 264 errors in code nobody wrote — which reads as the
      change having broken the lint, long after the actual test was fixed.
